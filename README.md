-  **`/config`**: This directory contains site-wide configuration.

-  **`/content`**: This directory contains content for the blocks on the page. The content is formated in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) and accepts some HTML as well.

-  **`/src`**: This directory contains all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for “source code”.

-  **`/static`**: This directory contains image and video assets and the fav icon. Replace the starter kit assets with your own.
